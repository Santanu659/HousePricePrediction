## General Information
- This project is to prdict the price of a house based on different factors
- A US-based housing company, Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. So this model has been prepared based on the data available to predict the factors which are impacting the price so that the company can figure out in which segment it has to give more emphasize and can able to purchase a house at a price lower than the sticker price.
- Regularisation method has been used to determine the influencing variables
- A data set from the sale of houses in Australia has been used here for the modelling.
